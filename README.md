 ## Overview
 This was a project I produced for a Java class I took during Spring of 2024. It keeps track of employees by their ID, ensuring that they do not repeat and adds them by either salary or hourly pay.

 Lastly it forces the user to delete an employee as the instructions requested. 

 ## Known_Issues

 I used a lot of documentation to make this project.
